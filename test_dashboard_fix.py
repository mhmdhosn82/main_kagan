Test to verify that the dashboard section is created correctly
even when there are no recent invoices.

This test verifies the fix for the KeyError 'dashboard' issue in main.py line 194.
The fix ensures that self.sections['dashboard'] assignment happens outside the
for loop, so it executes even when the recent invoices list is empty.
